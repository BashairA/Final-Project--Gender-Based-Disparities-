# Final Project Gender Based Disparities
I worked in this project with my classmates. We will dissect Amin and Islam's research, using a completely different data set. Not only will we confirm if the results of Amin and Islam's findings are plausible—is there a higher presence to females in the service sector—but we will take their research to new level by extending to their findings. We will explore if the presence of female in the workforce can influence a firm’s productivity, i.e. sales and profits. Since Amin and Islam have already concluded that there is a higher presence of females in small firms, we will be using a focused dataset on a survey sample of micro and small enterprises in seven developing countries. We will be using various models that we learned in class, including Linear Regression, Logit Models, and Lowess Models to explore this topic. A step-by-step approach will be taken to answer various questions linked to understanding the role female managers in the workplace. We will also be supporting our findings with research completed by Pat Richardson, Rhona Howarth, and Gerry Finnegan, in their research paper, “The Challenges of Growing Small Businesses:Insight from Women Entrepreneurs”. Finnegan et all research investigates the possible reasons for gender disparities in developing countries. Because Amin and Islam’s article only produced a descriptive outcome of the data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, and lacked in analysis of why there is gender-based disparity, we will turn to Finnegan’s research paper for answers. 
# The Dataset
The data used is Business Practices in Small Firms in Developing Countries between 2008-2014. In contrast with the World Bank's Enterprise Survey, we will only be focusing on a smaller set of 7 countries that are dispersed across the world. These countries (2 South Asian, 3 African, 2 Latin American) are good representatives of the developing countries: Bangladesh, Kenya, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Chile, and Nigeria. The survey that was taken examines micro, small level enterprises using 26 questions related to business practices.
# Questions 
*What sectors have a higher female presence?
*Simple Regression: Could there be another explanation, other than female presence, that drives company’s profit?
*What other variables can play a role in company's profit? Does the size of a firm play a role in the presence of female managers?
*Complicated Regression: What are possible reasons for gender disparity in developing countries?
*Are women faced with a disadvantage from managerial opportunities because they work less hours?
*Are female-run businesses are more profitable than male-run businesses?
*How does education play a role in company’s profit?
*How does business practices employed by women differ from those employed by men? Is there a correlation?

We use R to answers this questions and find the conclusion.
